### Welcome to the Jungle!

# About

 I love technology and what it represents. I have been working with it for about a decade, since technologies applied in industry, such as PLC and microcontrollers, as high-level languages designed for enterprise solutions, like Java and .NET. I believe that people solve problems, not technologies, and there is no reason to be held hostage by frameworks or even libraries, as long as you have a strong grounded concepts both provided by theory and experience.

Software Developer Advisor at Dell Computers and Masters student in the Applied Computing Graduate Program at the University of Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos). I received the Information Systems bachelor degree in 2017 and the Big Data, Data Science and Data Analytics graduate degree in 2019. Nowadays, I work as a Software Developer Advisor, solving business problems using cutting-edge technologies and guiding other developers in the software development process. Also, I research in Software Engineering, seeking for developing tools capable of improving developer’s productivity and bringing to them a better life quality.
